  ```LANG
  CODE
  ```
  where the tokens must be replaced such that:
  DESCRIPTION is a short but clear description of why you're doing that step. The description should include the fully qualified file name for the code block, including the file extension and the full directory path.
  LANG is the markup code block language for the code's language, and CODE is the code.

  Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.
  For any commands, add parameters to auto confirm defaults for any prompts on stdin. 
  Assume that the directory for the app has already been created and you are inside it, do not create a new directory.
  Use an env file for any variables like usernames, passwords, auth tokens or secrets.
